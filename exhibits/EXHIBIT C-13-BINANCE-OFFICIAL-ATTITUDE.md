# EXHIBIT C-13: BINANCE'S QUESTIONABLE TIMESTAMP CLAIM WITH NO CLEAR EXPLANATION

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This exhibit documents the Respondent's (Binance) questionable timestamp claim regarding when the system malfunction began. Binance publicly stated the issues started "following 21:18 UTC", but the Claimant has evidence suggesting system problems began significantly earlier.

---

## 2. BINANCE'S OFFICIAL STATEMENT

On October 10, 2025, Binance released an announcement stating:

> **Official Statement Text**:
> *"We would like to inform you that following 2025-10-10 21:18 (UTC), some platform modules briefly experienced technical glitches... certain assets encountered de-pegging issues due to sharp market fluctuations."*
> 
> *"Severe de-pegging occurred after 21:36 (UTC)."*

### 2.1 No Explanation for the Specific Cause

Binance's statement provides no explanation for:
1.  What specific cause led to the "severe de-pegging" after 21:36 UTC.
2.  Which specific module experienced the "technical glitches".
3.  What the root cause of the failure was.

Users are left to speculate on their own. Regarding the "severe de-pegging" after 21:36 UTC, the community has theorized that this may have been caused by continuous cascade liquidations triggered by the Unified Account system. However, Binance has never confirmed, denied, or explained this—leaving users to guess the actual cause. This lack of transparency not only burdens users but also **wastes the time and resources of arbitrators, lawyers, and the tribunal** who must now expend effort to investigate matters that Binance could have clarified from the outset.

## 3. NO CLEAR EXPLANATION PROVIDED

Despite public admission of the "glitch", the Respondent has provided no clear explanation for the anomalies observed—especially those occurring before their stated 21:18 UTC start time.

### 3.1 Unanswered Questions
The Claimant and the wider community have sought explanations for:
1.  Why 21:18 UTC?: What specific event at 21:18 UTC triggered Binance's classification of the "glitch"?
2.  Earlier Anomalies: Why are system issues occurring around 16:40-17:00 UTC not addressed?
3.  Which Module Failed?: Binance never specified which "platform modules" malfunctioned.
4.  Root Cause?: No technical explanation has been provided—users are left to guess.

### 3.2 Public Evidence Request (October 27, 2025)

On October 27, 2025, the Claimant publicly requested specific technical data from Binance (the post received over 430,000 views). A Binance representative (@moonkimbinance) replied to this thread, acknowledging the inquiry:

However, Binance failed to provide any of the following:

**1) Mark Price / Index Price / Price Bands**
   - Mark Price (per-second) + Algorithm Version
   - Index Components, Weightings, and Trimming Logs (full data for the critical minutes)
   - Price Bands (Upper/Lower) per-second + "Out-of-Band Rejection Volume" per-second + Manual Intervention Records

**2) Liquidation / ADL (System Level)**
   - Liquidation/ADL Order Volume and Notional, Queue Lengths, Matching Engine Resource Usage (per-second)
   - Risk Engine Version & Parameter Changes (Event Window ±1 hour): MMR Table, ADL Rules, Change Logs

**3) Insurance Fund**
   - Balance and Inflows/Outflows (per-second, including account/counterparty details)
   - Funding Gap & Disposal Priority (Injection / Pause / Call Auction / Price Band Adjustment)

**4) Matching Neutrality / Proprietary Net Selling**
   - "No Proprietary Net Selling" Declaration + Merkle Root of Proprietary/Affiliated Account Set
   - Proprietary Net Delta vs. Market Maker Net Delta per-second during Event Window (anonymized fields acceptable)

**5) Operations & Change Control**
   - Event Window ±1 hour: "Freeze/Approval Records" & Version Hashes for Parameters/Code/Rate Limit Thresholds
   - Platform Overall Health: p50/p95 Latency, Error Rate, Availability per-second; Call Auction/Halt Trigger Records

Result: Despite public acknowledgment from their representative, Binance has provided none of this data.

## 4. CONCLUSION

The Claimant's position is based on two key issues:

1.  **No Explanation of What Happened**: Binance has never explained what specifically occurred during the incident—neither the root cause, nor which modules failed, nor the mechanism behind the "severe de-pegging".

2.  **System Anomalies Occurred Before 21:18 UTC**: The Claimant has evidence that many system anomalies were already occurring before Binance's claimed start time of 21:18 UTC. Binance has not addressed or acknowledged these earlier issues.

The Respondent's refusal to provide transparency on these points demonstrates a lack of good faith.

Given Binance's continued obstruction, the Claimant has no choice but to:
1.  Pursue arbitration to resolve this dispute.
2.  Seek discovery through the arbitration process to compel Binance to produce the technical data they have refused to provide voluntarily.
