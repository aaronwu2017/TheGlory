# EXHIBIT C-13: BINANCE'S OFFICIAL ATTITUDE: ADMISSION OF FAILURE AND SUBSEQUENT DATA WITHHOLDING

**EVIDENCE REFERENCE**: **C-13**
**SUBJECT**: **Binance's Contradictory Stance and Comparison of Public Admission vs. Private Unresponsiveness**
**DATE**: **October 2025 - Present**

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This exhibit documents the Respondent's (Binance) inconsistent and obstructive attitude towards the Claimant. While the Respondent publicly admitted to "technical glitches" immediately following the incident, they have subsequently engaged in a pattern of evasion and **data withholding** when specifically requested to provide transaction logs and system data necessary for the Claimant to verify the extent of the damage.

This dual-faced approach—**public admission of fault** combined with **private refusal to cooperate**—demonstrates a lack of good faith in resolving the dispute.

## 2. PART I: VAGUE PUBLIC ADMISSION WITHOUT SPECIFICS

On October 10, 2025, immediately following the outage, Binance released an official announcement acknowledging the failure. However, this admission was **superficial and lacked any specific technical details**.

*   **Date of Admission**: 2025-10-10
*   **Time Identified**: Following 21:18 UTC
*   **Nature of Admission**: A generic statement citing "technical glitches" and "de-pegging," without explaining the root cause, scope, or specific modules affected.

> **Official Statement Text**:
> *"We would like to inform you that following 2025-10-10 21:18 (UTC), some platform modules briefly experienced technical glitches... certain assets encountered de-pegging issues due to sharp market fluctuations."*
>
> **Source Link**: [Binance Announcement (Archived)](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-regarding-technical-glitches-on-binance-platform-2025-10-10)

While this confirms the Respondent **was aware** of the system failure, they have strategically avoided disclosing **what actually happened**, treating the incident as a minor "glitch" rather than a catastrophic failure of their core matching and risk engines.

## 3. PART II: PASSIVE RESISTANCE AND DATA WITHHOLDING (OCTOBER 2025)

despite the clear public admission above, the Respondent adopted an obstructive stance when the Claimant attempted to retrieve their own trading data and system logs to calculate losses.

### 3.1 The Claimant's Request for Data
In **October 2025**, following the substantial financial loss, the Claimant formally contacted Binance Support/Representatives to request:
1.  Complete transaction and order logs during the outage period.
2.  Specific data regarding order rejection reasons (e.g., "Service Unavailable" errors).
3.  Explanation for the specific liquidation execution prices.

### 3.2 The Respondent's "Read but No Reply" Strategy
The Claimant observed a consistent pattern of **unresponsiveness**:
*   Messages sent to Binance support/representatives were marked as **"Read"** (or acknowledged as received).
*   **No substantive response** was provided.
*   The Respondent **failed to provide** the requested data, effectively preventing the Claimant from fully reconstructing the event using the exchange's own verifyable records.

> **[PLACEHOLDER FOR EVIDENCE]**
> *Note to Claimant: If you have screenshots of the chat history showing "Read" status with no reply, or ignored emails from October, please insert them here or attach them as referencing this section.*

### 3.3 Implication of Withholding
The refusal to provide data—especially when the Claimant ultimately retrieved partial data (Exhibits C-2, C-4) through other means—suggests the Respondent intentionally withheld information that would confirm the severity of the system failure was greater than the "brief glitch" publicly admitted.

### 3.4 Community-Led Technical Demands & Binance's Evasion (October 27, 2025)

On **October 27, 2025**, a comprehensive list of technical demands regarding the outage was published publicly, garnering significant attention (**over 430,000 views**). A Binance representative (e.g., **@moonkimbinance**) publicly replied to this thread, acknowledging the inquiry.

Despite this high-profile engagement and the representative's presence, Binance **failed to provide** any of the specific forensic data requested. The Claimant adopts these community-verified technical questions as critical evidence requirements which the Respondent has refused to fulfill:

1.  **Feed / Mark Price / Price Bands**
    *   Mark Price (per second resolution) + Algorithm Version used at the time.
    *   Index Components, Weightings, and Trimming Logs (Full volume logs for the relevant minutes).
    *   Price Bands (Upper/Lower) per second + "Out-of-Band Rejection Volume" per second + Records of any Manual Intervention.

2.  **Liquidation / ADL (System Level)**
    *   Liquidation/ADL Volume vs. Notional Value, Queue Lengths, and Matching Engine Resource Usage (per second).
    *   Risk Engine Version & Parameter Changes (Event Window ±1 hour): MMR Table, ADL Rules, and Change Logs.

3.  **Insurance Fund**
    *   Balance & Inflows/Outflows (per second, including specific subjects/counterparties).
    *   Funding Gap & Disposal Priority records (Injection / Pause / Call Auction / Band Adjustment).

4.  **Matching Neutrality / Proprietary Net Selling**
    *   Declaration of "No Proprietary Net Selling" + Merkle Root of Proprietary/Affiliate Accounts.
    *   Proprietary Net Delta vs. Market Maker Net Delta per second during the event window (Anonymized fields acceptable).

5.  **Operations & Change Control**
    *   Event Window ±1 hour: "Freeze/Approval Records" & Version Hashes for Parameters/Code/Rate Limit Thresholds.
    *   Platform Overall Health: p50/p95 Latency, Error Rate, Availability per second; Call Auction/Halt Trigger Records.

**Result**: Even after public pressure and direct engagement from their representative, Binance has provided **none** of this requested data to the public or the Claimant.

## 4. CONCLUSION ON RESPONDENT'S ATTITUDE

The combination of **Part I (Public Admission)** and **Part II (Data Withholding)** paints a clear picture of the Respondent's attitude:
1.  They **know** the system failed (as admitted publicly).
2.  They are **actively preventing** the Claimant from proving the specific impact of that failure on their account by withholding key data.
3.  This conduct constitutes a breach of the user's right to information and transparency, further validating the Claimant's move to arbitration.
