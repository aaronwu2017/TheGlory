## Summary

- The displayed snapshots show active buy-side interest during the incident window; market participants were submitting bids across venues.
- Binance system outages prevented normal matching and quote updates, so its order book failed to reflect the real buy pressure visible elsewhere.
- This mismatch between external buy demand and Binance's stalled book suggests the outage, not a lack of buyers, drove the observed price dislocation on Binance.
- The evidence indicates customers were willing to purchase at prevailing prices, but Binance's infrastructure disruption obscured and delayed that genuine liquidity.
